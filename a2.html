            Hi, I'm Jiaan Hu,is a student from Graphic Design.
            Well, I actually have some experience with coding and some language associate with computer science.
            I am a very crafty person, so this site will probably include some of the crafts I have done before.
            <br>I think this won't be worthless, coding can be use in many way in this world full of technology.

    <div id="work">
        <p2>
        
           This is my work from last year, it's a fashion poster. 
           I really like this one because I get a high score.
           <br>The image displaying on the left is my work.

        <p3>
            Now I would like to introduce two artist I admire, who have a really big infulence on my practice.<br>
            The first one will be Alexey brodovitch, he is a photographer in 20th century. I am really inspired by his composition use in photo and the combination he put with graphic.

        <h4>
            This is the first website I have produced.
            He may have many problems and is not so perfect.
            But I believe I can improve myself and make a better website after my later study.
            Hope you will also enjoy the my page.
            Have a nice day!!!
